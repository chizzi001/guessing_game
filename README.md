# A GUESSING GAME

## Description

This is a guessing game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user will be prompted to enter a number and the program will tell the user if the number is too high or too low. The user will be prompted to enter a new number until the correct number is guessed. Once the correct number is guessed, the program will tell the user how many guesses it took to get the correct number.
